★ Lexical analysis is the first phase in the compilation process.
★ Lexical analyzer (scanner) scans the whole source program and when it finds the meaningful sequence of characters (lexemes) then it converts it into a token
★ Token: lexemes mapped into token-name and attribute-value.
Example: int -> <keyword, int>
★ It always matches the longest character sequence.
